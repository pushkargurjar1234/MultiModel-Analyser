Multimodal Analyzer – Text & Image Understanding System
Objective

Build a web application where users can submit text and an image, and the backend analyzes both modalities (NLP + Computer Vision) to generate combined insights and automated responses.

Features
Backend (Python: FastAPI / Flask)

Endpoint: /analyze → Accepts JSON containing text + image

NLP Tasks:

Topic Classification (e.g., News / Review / Comment)

Sentiment Analysis (Positive / Negative / Neutral)

Text Summarization for long inputs

Computer Vision Tasks:

Image Classification (e.g., Detect person, object, or scene)

OCR (Text Extraction)

Toxic Content Detection in image text (if OCR finds abusive words)

(Optional) Face Emotion Recognition for faces in images

Fusion Logic (Multimodal Response Generator):

If sentiment = Negative and image shows angry face → Reply empathetically

If text = “I love this product” and image = product box → Reply with positive acknowledgment

If toxicity is detected (in text or OCR) → Return a warning

Frontend (React)

Input box for text and image upload

Analyze button → Sends data to backend

Results display (Cards or Chat Style) showing:

Text Sentiment + Summary

Topic Classification

Image Category + OCR Extracted Text

Toxicity Warnings (if any)

Automated Response

Sample User Flow

User Uploads:

Text: "I hate how messy this restaurant is."

Image: Restaurant photo with "Dirty" written on the wall

Backend Returns:

{
  "text_sentiment": "Negative",
  "text_summary": "Complaint about restaurant cleanliness",
  "image_classification": "Restaurant/Indoor",
  "ocr_text": "Dirty",
  "toxicity_score": 0.78,
  "automated_response": "We’re sorry about your negative experience. We’ll investigate the restaurant’s cleanliness."
}


Frontend Displays:

Sentiment: Negative

Topic: Food/Restaurant Review

Image: Restaurant

OCR: "Dirty"

Toxicity: 78%

Response: Apology + reassurance

Tech Stack

Backend: Python, FastAPI / Flask, Hugging Face Transformers, Ultralytics YOLO (for object detection), OpenCV, Tesseract OCR

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS (or any UI framework)

Other Libraries: PIL (Python Imaging Library), Torch, Transformers

Installation & Running
Backend
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload

Frontend
# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run React app
npm run dev


Open browser at http://localhost:3000 (or Vite/React dev URL) to access the app.

Usage

Enter text and upload an image

Click Analyze

View multimodal insights, including:

Sentiment, Topic, Image category

OCR extracted text

Toxicity score

Automated response

Notes

YOLO detects objects, not full scene. For scene recognition, integrate Places365.

CPU is default; GPU recommended for faster image processing.
